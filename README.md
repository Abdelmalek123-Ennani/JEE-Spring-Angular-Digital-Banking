#### Description
<p>
I have created a project for developing a banking application that enables the management of bank accounts. Each account belongs to a client, and an account can undergo multiple DEBIT or CREDIT operations. There are two types of accounts: Current Accounts and Savings Accounts.
</p>
<p>
The project I have created is a user-friendly and efficient application for managing bank accounts. The application aims to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience.
</p>

<p>
Each bank account in the application is associated with a specific client. Users have the option to create either a Current Account or a Savings Account based on their financial needs. Current Accounts are intended for daily transactions such as expenses, payments, and transfers, while Savings Accounts are designed for long-term savings purposes.
</p>

<p>
Users can perform various operations on their accounts, including DEBIT and CREDIT operations. DEBIT operations represent withdrawals or payments made from the account, while CREDIT operations represent deposits or money transfers added to the account.
</p>

<p>
The application offers a range of features for managing bank accounts. Users can view their current balance, access transaction history, make transfers between their own accounts, as well as conduct transfers to other bank accounts.
</p>

<p>
In addition to account and transaction management, the application also prioritizes the security of users' financial data. Sensitive information is encrypted and protected using advanced security measures to ensure the confidentiality of banking data.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the application I have created is a banking management platform that allows users to monitor their finances, manage DEBIT and CREDIT operations, and take control of their Current and Savings Accounts securely and conveniently.
